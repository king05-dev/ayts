🌱 AYTS — Local Marketplace App

A community-driven platform to browse and order from local stores.

📌 Project Overview

AYTS is a mobile-first marketplace connecting users to local community stores such as groceries, pharmacies, vegetable vendors, water refillers, and construction suppliers. Users select their location and browse available stores, products, and place orders for delivery.

This project is currently frontend-first using v0 with Supabase planned for backend integration.
